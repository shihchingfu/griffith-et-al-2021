## Summary {.smaller}

- There may be a lag between X-ray and UV emission of AGNs but is hard to detect because of gaps in light curves.
- GPs can interpolate the gaps and recover the lag.
- Apply Structure Function Analysis to identify broken power law breakpoints.
- Confirmed the lag is similar to previous studies


(1) Simulation study to select kernel 
    - Matern $\frac{1}{2}$ and Rational Quadratic
(2) Fit GP model to X-ray and UV light curves from Mrk 335
    - fit broken power law
    - estimate lag

## Data

- Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 335
- Swift X-ray and UVW2 light curves
- Time bins of one day
- MJD 54327 to 58626
- N = 509 (X-ray band)
- N = 498 (UVW2 band)

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

$H_0$: Sample was drawn from Gaussian distribution


At $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level:

- Fail to reject $H_0$ for X-ray (p = 0.164).

- Reject $H_0$ for UV (p = $1 \times 10^{-20}$).

- Fail to reject $H_0$ for log transformed UV (p = 0.028)

. . . 

OK, but perhaps unnatural to transform data to match likelihood.



## Sim. Study Metholodology

1. Simulate 1,000 light curves in X-ray and UV bands (4390 time points).
2. Introduce unevenly spaced gaps in each light curve.
3. Fit GP model with five different kernels (M 1/2, M 3/2, M 5/2, RQ, SE).
4. Quantify fit using residual sum of squared errors (RSS)
5. Calculate the negative log marginal likelihood (NLML)
6. Average the RSS and NLML for each kernel.

# GP on Mrk 335 Observations


## Notes about GP

- Data is standardised before fitting, which effectively removes one of the kernel hyperparameters
- Mean function set to zero
- Kernels are stationary

## Structure Function

PSD computation is complicated because of the uneven sampling of data so use structure function analysis instead.

$$\mathrm{SF}(\tau) = \frac{1}{N(\tau)} \sum_i \left[ f(t_i) - f(t_i + \tau)\right]^2$$

where $f(t_i)$ is the count rate at $t_i$, $\tau = t_j - t_i$, and $t_j \gt t_i$.

This is basically an analysis of _autocorrelations_.

## Conclusions

- GP kernels do not give same results therefore no strong evidence for break in X-ray power law.
- Dips in structure function are due to uneven sampling.
- Broad lag feature of up to 30 days.

## Statistical Comments

Good

- Very nice introduction to GPs.
- Simulation study is well structured.

## Statistical Comments

OK

- Structure function analysis assumes stationarity.
- Fitting power law to GP fit might be mispecified.
- Uneven sampling eliminates PSD, but still causes problems for structure function.

## Statistical Comments

Dubious

- Gaussian likelihood for count rate data.
- Correlation between RSS and NLML is a weak argument.
- t-test for determining whether RSS was significant suffers from pseudo-replication and multiple-testing.


## Bayes' Theorem

$$ P(\theta | D) = \frac{P(D | \theta) \times P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$

$$\textrm{posterior} = \frac{\textrm{likelihood} \times \textrm{prior}}{\textrm{marginal likelihood}}$$

## Bayesian Model Selection

The Bayes Factor, $K$, is the ratio of two marginal likelihoods.

$$K = \frac{P(D \mid M_1)}{P(D \mid M_2)} = \dots = \frac{P(M_1 | D)}{P(M_2|D)} \cdot \frac{P(M_2)}{P(M_1)}$$

If the two models have the same prior probability, the Bayes Factor is equal to the ratio of the posterior probabilities.

If $K \gt 1$ then $M_1$ is more supported by the data than $M_2$.

## Negative Log Marginal Likelihood

\begin{align}

 - \log P(\boldsymbol{y}\mid\boldsymbol{t}, \theta) &= -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{y}^\top (K_\theta(\boldsymbol{t},\boldsymbol{t}) + \sigma_y^2I)^{-1}\boldsymbol{y}\\ &-\frac{1}{2}\log | K_\theta(\boldsymbol{t},\boldsymbol{t}) + \sigma_y^2I|\\ &+ \frac{N}{2}\log(2\pi)
\end{align}
